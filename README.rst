The **blighty** project is inspired by conky. In essence, it is a collection of
objects that allow you to quickly create a transparent window that you can draw
on with cairo. But instead of coding your widgets in Lua, that perhaps end up
calling Python as external tools, you can now code them natively in Python.

Performance won't be as great as conky, with probably more resource being used
for the same end result, but native Python support opens up for a lot more
customisation possibilities in a snap of your fingers.

There won't be much you can do with minimal effort out of the box while the
project is in its infancy. If you like the idea, you are more than welcome to
contribute to this project!
