    """Extension of the standard `cairo.Context` class.

    This class is used to extend the vanilla `cairo.Context` with _brushes_.
    These are either methods of a subclass of `Canvas` that are prefixed with
    `draw_`, or those that are explicitly decorated with the `@brush`
    decorator.

    There shouldn't be any reasons why you'd want to use instantiate this class
    directly. The `ctx` argument that is passed to the `Canvas` `on_draw`
    callback is an instance of this class. This can be passed as an argument
    to any callable object that expects a `cairo.Context` instance. The
    underlying `Canvas` object can be accessed via the `canvas` attribute. This
    can be useful if one needs to refer to the parent canvas geometry (e.g.
    its size).
