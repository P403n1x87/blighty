Description
===========

This module provides the ``Canvas`` class for the creation of X11 canvases.

We advise that you consider using the ``Canvas`` class provided by the
:mod:`blighty.x11` submodule instead, as it gives more portability
acrossdifferent display managers. The interface of
:class:`blighty.gtk.canvas.Canvas` is identical to that of
:class:`blighty.x11.canvas.Canvas`, so we refer you to the latter for more
details of how to deal with GTK canvases. The key difference is basically in
the class that your canvases have to extend. For example, if you have an
X11-based canvas and you have the following import in your source code::

    from blighty.x11 import Canvas, start_event_loop

all you have to do is replace ``blighty.x11`` with ``blighty.gtk``::

    from blighty.gtk import Canvas, start_event_loop

and the same code will work just fine and will produce the same result.

Here is the same simple example from the :mod:`blighty.x11` module, adapted
to the GTK case::

    from blighty import CanvasGravity
    from blighty.gtk import Canvas, start_event_loop

    class MyCanvas(Canvas):
        @staticmethod
        def build(x, y):
            return MyCanvas(x, y, 200, 200, gravity = CanvasGravity.NORTH)

        def on_button_pressed(self, button, state, x, y):
            if button == 1:  # Left mouse button pressed
                self.dispose()

        def on_draw(self, ctx):
            ctx.set_source_rgb(1, 0, 0)
            ctx.rectangle(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width >> 1, ctx.canvas.height >> 1)
            ctx.fill()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Instantiate the canvas
        canvas = MyCanvas.build()

        # Map it on screen
        canvas.show()

        # Start the event loop
        start_event_loop()

The only difference is on the second line, where we reference the
:mod:`blighty.gtk` submodule instead of :mod:`blighty.x11`.


Extra features
==============

There are some features that are unique to GTK canvases only. This implies
that, if you have a GTK canvas and you use some of these features, you won't
be able to run the same code as an X11 canvas without changes.


Access the underlying GTK window
--------------------------------

GTK canvases are special GTK windows that have been configured to be used as
desktop widgets. Every instance of the :class:`blighty.gtk.canvas.Canvas` class
will expose the underlying :class:`GTKWindow` via ``self``.
